This is a toy lang with an interpreter. 
Made while reading crafting interpreters in Go. Maybe in the future reimplement 
this lang in other languages, but for now I'm enjoying playing with Go and the 
book uses it as well so a win-win.

For more specs:

Lexer only supports for now 2 digits tokens;

Wrote my own parser because I wanted to understand it, aka : "Pratt parser"
